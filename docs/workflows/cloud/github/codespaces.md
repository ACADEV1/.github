# Editing single files on GitHub (web)
This will be done using:
- The GitHub website
- Access to your team/project

<br>

### 1. Make sure you're on the correct branch
1. Navigate to your repo page, it should look like this:
    ![should be found at https://github.com/ACADEV1/ [repo name] ](../../../static/repo-page-example.png)
2. On the left, be sure the 'dev' branch is selected like in the image 

<br>

### 2. Creating/opening a Codespace
1. Press the green ‘Code’ dropdown on the right
2. Press the ‘Codespaces’ tab, and ‘Create Codespace on ...’ 
3. This will open an online editor, where you can edit the files. 
4. Edit the file(s) you want, and press CTRL+S to save 

<br>

### 3. Committing and pushing (saving changes)
1. Click the ‘Source control’ tab, in the left bar (3rd down from the top menu button)
2. Press the three dots on the right side at the top of the side panel
3. Press pull
4. Press the plus button next to the files which changes you want to include in the commit
5. Type a descriptive message in the message box of the change
6. Press commit
    - ‘No staged commits’ message means no changes have been added
7. When you’re ready, press ‘Sync Changes’

NOTE: You can also use the terminal to do this, like in [Coding to Cloud w/ Local](https://github.com/ACADEV1/.github/blob/dev/docs/workflows/cloud/local/README.md#5-committing-and-pushing-saving-changes)

<br>

### 4. Your changes reflected
1. Back at the the start page of the repo there should be a URL in the README
3. Upon clicking the URL, given a short moment for the CD system to update, your changes should be visible

<br>

## Does this mean a short wait for each update?
Yes, see the [cloud README](https://github.com/ACADEV1/.github/blob/dev/docs/workflows/cloud/README.md#does-this-mean-a-short-wait-for-each-update)
