# Editing single files on GitHub (web)
This will be done using:
- The GitHub website
- Access to your team/project

<br>

### 1. Make sure you're on the correct branch
1. Navigate to your repo page, it should look like this:
    ![should be found at https://github.com/ACADEV1/ [repo name] ](../../../static/repo-page-example.png)
2. On the left, be sure the 'dev' branch is selected like in the image 

<br>

### 2. Navigate and select a file
On the same page as above, click on folders and files to navigate

<br>

### 3. Edit the file
1. Click a file through to see the content
2. In the far right in the bar above text content, there is a pencil icon
3. This enters the edit mode, you can change the content now

<br>

### 5. Committing and pushing (saving changes)
1. After changing content, the 'Commit changes' green button on the right should be lit up; press this
2. Set a short descriptive title of the change made in the first box
3. Add a more thorough description in the bottom box
4. Select commit directly to the dev branch (if this says another branch, copy your changes and do step 1 again)
5. Press commit changes

<br>

### 6. Your changes reflected
1. Back at the the start page of the repo there should be a URL in the README
3. Upon clicking the URL, given a short moment for the CD system to update, your changes should be visible

<br>

Yes, see the [cloud README](https://github.com/ACADEV1/.github/blob/dev/docs/workflows/cloud/README.md#does-this-mean-a-short-wait-for-each-update)
