# Setting up a monorepo (a project category)
The category/monorepo for projects to go into, for example: [p000](https://github.com/ACADEV1/app1_p000). This is one of the more involved processes, but it makes setting up projects simpler.

If you're looking for a guide on how to set up a project, like **p001_Example**, go [back](https://github.com/ACADEV1/.github/blob/dev/docs/onboarding/README.md).

This will be done using:
- Administrative Plesk (Web) access: 
    - app1.startupstatus.co
    - app1sandbox.startupstatus.co
    - app1dev.startupstatus.co
- Administrative GitHub (Web) access
- Plesk SSH (bash scripting)
