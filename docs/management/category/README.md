# Managing a monorepo (a project category)
Monorepos exist to:
- **Manage the CI/CD functionality and build process**
- A sorting system which makes it easier to find your project

###### Project = a repository, a directory inside of a pXXX category
###### Monorepo = the category projects are in, like app1_p000
###### CD/Build/Deployment Process = how the code updates to the server
