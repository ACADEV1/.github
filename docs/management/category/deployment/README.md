# Setting up the deployment of a category
How code makes it to the dev/prod **Plesk** servers automatically, and how it's hooked up the dev sandbox. This is one of the more involved processes, but it makes setting up projects simpler.

This will be done using:
- Administrative Plesk (Web) access: 
    - app1.startupstatus.co
    - app1sandbox.startupstatus.co
    - app1dev.startupstatus.co
- Administrative GitHub (Web) access
- Plesk SSH (for setting up a bash script)
